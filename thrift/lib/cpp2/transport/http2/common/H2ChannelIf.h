/**
 * Interface that specializes ThriftChannelIf for HTTP/2.  It supports
 * the translation between Thrift payloads and HTTP/2 streams.
 * Concrete implementations support different translation strategies.
 *
 * Objects of this class operate on a single HTTP/2 stream and run on
 * the thread managing the HTTP/2 network connection for that stream.
 *
 * Lifetime for objects of this class is managed via shared pointers:
 *
 * On the client side, [TO BE COMPLETED]
 *
 * On the server side, an H2RequestHandler object creates a shared
 * pointer of a channel object following which additional shared
 * pointers are passed to the single ThriftProcessor object using
 * shared_from_this().  When both the H2RequestHandler object and the
 * ThriftProcessor object are done with the channel object, all the
 * shared pointers are released and the channel object gets destroyed.
 *
 * Threading constraints:
 *
 * On the client side, [TO BE COMPLETED]
 *
 * On the server side, channel objects are created on a Proxygen
 * thread that manages an HTTP/2 connection.  This object calls the
 * ThriftProcessor object to perform the thrift call.  The thrift side
 * the calls back into this object via "sendThriftResponse()".  The
 * callback must be be scheduled on the event base of the Proxygen
 * thread.
